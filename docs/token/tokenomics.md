### How Staking Works

Staking HST tokens provides users with several benefits beyond access to the platform:

1. **Earning Rewards**:
   - Users who stake their HST tokens will earn rewards over time. These rewards can come in the form of additional HST tokens or other incentives, such as discounts on platform fees, exclusive access to features, or premium content.

2. **Tiered Access**:
   - Staking will enable users to achieve different tiers based on the amount of HST staked. Each tier offers unique benefits and access levels:
     - **Starter Tier**: Users staking a minimum of $50 worth of HST a month will gain access to starter platform features and community events.
     - **Growth Tier**: Users staking a minimum of $200 worth of HST a month will gain access to growth platform features, priority access to new features, and eligibility for beta testing.
     - **Business Tier**: Users staking a minimum of $400 worth of HST a month will gain access to business platform features and will enjoy exclusive access to premium features, governance voting rights, and enhanced customer support.

3. **Long-term Engagement**:
   - Staking encourages long-term engagement within the Histori ecosystem. Users are incentivized to hold their tokens rather than sell them, promoting stability in the token's market value and enhancing the community.

4. **Dynamic Pricing Mechanism**:
   - The staking mechanism will utilize a dynamic pricing approach, where the required staking amounts for each tier may adjust based on market conditions and the current value of HST. This ensures fairness and responsiveness to fluctuations in the token's market price.

### Permit Mechanism for Gas Savings

The **Histori (HST) token** supports a permit mechanism, allowing users to save on gas fees compared to traditional ERC20 token approvals. With the permit mechanism, users can authorize token deposits with a **single transaction**, eliminating the need for separate `approve` and `deposit` calls.

### Vesting Details

1. **Investors**: Investors will have a 12-month cliff, meaning they will receive no tokens during the first year. After the cliff, tokens will vest linearly over the next 24 months.
   
2. **Team**: Team members will also have a 12-month cliff, with the remaining tokens vesting linearly over 36 months to ensure long-term commitment.

3. **Advisors**: Advisors will experience a shorter vesting period with a 6-month cliff and linear vesting over the next 12 months.

4. **Early Adopters**: Early adopters will have a 6-month cliff, followed by linear vesting over 12 months to reward their support.

5. **ICO**: Tokens allocated for the ICO will be available for purchase during the ICO period, enabling the community to participate in the initial offering.

6. **Staking Rewards and Development Fund**: These will be allocated gradually to encourage participation and platform development, ensuring a steady flow of tokens to users and developers.

### Conclusion

The Histori tokenomics is designed to balance the needs of investors, team members, and the broader community while fostering sustainable growth. With a clear allocation strategy and growth projections, HST aims to incentivize long-term engagement and establish a robust ecosystem for accessing historical blockchain data. The inclusion of early adopters and an ICO ensures that the community is actively involved from the outset, enhancing the project's reach and impact. Staking offers numerous benefits, rewarding users for their commitment to the Histori platform.
