title: Risk Management and Fraud Detection
---

### Why  
Blockchainâ€™s decentralized and transparent nature introduces both opportunities and risks. While blockchain provides security through immutability, it also opens the door to sophisticated forms of fraud, such as phishing, rug pulls, and other scams. Risk management teams need effective tools to detect and respond to these threats in real time, as well as identify suspicious activities that could indicate fraud. Having access to historical data helps to identify patterns of abnormal behavior and protect assets.

### How  
Our API allows security experts and fraud detection teams to monitor blockchain activities across networks. By analyzing historical transaction logs, balances, and contract interactions, organizations can build risk profiles and detect early signs of fraudulent behavior. With tools to track wallet activities, token allowances, and contract logs, suspicious behavior can be detected, flagged, and mitigated before it leads to significant financial loss.

### Achieved Using Our API  
- Use the **`/chain/logs`** endpoint to filter logs for suspicious events. By monitoring token transfers or interactions with vulnerable smart contracts, risk management teams can identify unusual activities or abnormal transaction patterns.

    ```http
    GET https://api.histori.xyz/v1/eth-mainnet/chain/logs?startBlock=123456&endBlock=123999&contractAddress=0xabcdefabcdefabcdef
    ```

- Retrieve transaction details using the **`/transactions/{txHash}`** endpoint to analyze specific transactions for signs of fraudulent activity, such as unexpected fund transfers or interactions with suspicious contracts.

    ```http
    GET https://api.histori.xyz/v1/eth-mainnet/transactions/{txHash}
    ```

- Track historical token allowances using the **`/allowance/single`** endpoint. If a token has been granted excessive allowances to unknown wallets or contracts, it could be a sign of unauthorized access or exploitation.

    ```http
    GET https://api.histori.xyz/v1/eth-mainnet/allowance/single?owner=0x1234567890abcdef&spender=0xabcdefabcdefabcdef&tokenAddress=0xabcdefabcdefabcdef&blockNumber=123456
    ```

- Monitor token balances using the **`/balance/single`** endpoint to track wallet activity. Sudden, significant changes in balances could indicate potential fraud or unauthorized withdrawals.

    ```http
    GET https://api.histori.xyz/v1/eth-mainnet/balance/single?holder=0x1234567890abcdef&tokenAddress=0xabcdefabcdefabcdef&blockNumber=123456
    ```

- Use the **`/chain/logs/contract/{contractAddress}`** endpoint to investigate specific contract interactions for anomalies. This is especially useful in identifying whether smart contracts are being exploited or used in fraudulent schemes.

    ```http
    GET https://api.histori.xyz/v1/eth-mainnet/chain/logs/contract/0xabcdefabcdefabcdef?startBlock=123456&endBlock=123999
    ```

By combining transaction monitoring, allowance tracking, and contract log analysis, risk management teams can proactively identify and respond to potential fraud before it escalates. Our API enables real-time fraud detection and provides the historical data needed to trace and understand suspicious activities across the blockchain.
