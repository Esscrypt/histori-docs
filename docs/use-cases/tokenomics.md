title: Tokenomics and Market Analysis
---

### Why  
In the fast-paced world of blockchain, understanding the supply dynamics, liquidity, and pricing trends of tokens is key for investors, market analysts, and project teams. Tokenomics—the study of token supply and distribution—plays a vital role in determining the health and sustainability of a project. Market analysts need access to historical and real-time data to gauge token performance, assess liquidity, and identify price patterns. Accurate tokenomics and market analysis are essential for investors making informed decisions and for project teams optimizing their strategies.

### How  
Our API provides comprehensive tools to analyze token supply, balance distributions, and pricing trends. By accessing historical and real-time data on token allowances, supplies, and transaction details, market analysts can track how token metrics evolve over time, offering insights into market sentiment, liquidity, and overall token health. Whether analyzing price fluctuations or tracking token supply, the API delivers the data needed for deep tokenomics and market analysis.

### Achieved Using Our API  
- Use the **`/token-supply`** endpoint to retrieve the total supply of a token at specific points in time. This helps track inflation, deflation, or supply changes due to token burns or minting events.

    ```http
    GET https://api.histori.xyz/v1/eth-mainnet/token-supply?tokenAddress=0xabcdefabcdefabcdef&blockNumber=123456
    ```

- Monitor historical and real-time price data using the **`/uniswap/eth-usd-price`** endpoint. This allows market analysts to track the ETH/USDT price fluctuations, enabling a clear understanding of price trends over time.

    ```http
    GET https://api.histori.xyz/v1/eth-mainnet/uniswap/eth-usd-price
    ```

- Retrieve token balances across wallets using the **`/balance/single`** endpoint to see how tokens are distributed. This helps track whale movements or large shifts in token ownership, which can impact market sentiment.

    ```http
    GET https://api.histori.xyz/v1/eth-mainnet/balance/single?holder=0x1234567890abcdef&tokenAddress=0xabcdefabcdefabcdef&blockNumber=123456
    ```

- Analyze liquidity and trading activity by retrieving transaction details with the **`/transactions/{txHash}`** endpoint. Understanding how tokens are being traded can offer insight into market behavior and liquidity.

    ```http
    GET https://api.histori.xyz/v1/eth-mainnet/transactions/{txHash}
    ```

- Use the **`/allowance/single`** endpoint to track token allowances between users and contracts. This is useful for understanding how tokens are being locked or utilized in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

    ```http
    GET https://api.histori.xyz/v1/eth-mainnet/allowance/single?owner=0x1234567890abcdef&spender=0xabcdefabcdefabcdef&tokenAddress=0xabcdefabcdefabcdef&blockNumber=123456
    ```

By combining insights from token supply, balance distribution, transaction data, and price trends, market analysts and investors can get a comprehensive view of token performance and market dynamics. Our API empowers them with the data needed to make informed investment decisions and drive tokenomics research.
