title: Behavioral Analysis
---

### Why  
Blockchainâ€™s transparency provides a unique window into the behavior of users, wallets, and contracts on a global scale. Behavioral analysis can reveal key insights into user interactions, investment habits, and even token dynamics over time. By analyzing historical activities, organizations can better understand how users are engaging with decentralized applications (dApps), identify patterns in token transfers, and predict market sentiment.

### How  
Our API enables businesses, researchers, and developers to delve into the historical activities of wallets, tokens, and contracts. By accessing detailed transaction logs, token allowances, and balances, it becomes possible to track user behavior across time and identify emerging trends or irregular activities. This kind of behavioral analysis can drive user-centric innovations, fine-tune marketing strategies, or even detect market manipulation.

### Achieved Using Our API  
- Use the **`/transactions/{txHash}`** endpoint to retrieve detailed information about any blockchain transaction. Analyzing transactions over time helps identify buying and selling patterns or specific behavioral trends.

    ```http
    GET https://api.histori.xyz/v1/eth-mainnet/transactions/{txHash}
    ```

- The **`/allowance/single`** endpoint allows you to track token allowances between users and contracts, giving insights into how users are interacting with decentralized applications and token contracts over time.

    ```http
    GET https://api.histori.xyz/v1/eth-mainnet/allowance/single?owner=0x1234567890abcdef&tokenAddress=0xabcdefabcdefabcdef&timestamp=2022-01-01T00:00:00Z
    ```

- To analyze wallet activity over time, use the **`/balance/single`** endpoint to retrieve historical balances. This data helps in understanding wallet holdings and token movements, providing a clear view of user behavior.

    ```http
    GET https://api.histori.xyz/v1/eth-mainnet/balance/single?holder=0x1234567890abcdef&tokenAddress=0xabcdefabcdefabcdef&timestamp=2022-01-01T00:00:00Z
    ```

By combining transaction data, token allowances, and balance history, behavioral analysis becomes a powerful tool for understanding blockchain users, dApp interactions, and market behavior. This data can be used to optimize user experiences, detect unusual activities, and guide better decision-making.
