title: Regulatory & Compliance Monitoring
---


### Why  
As blockchain technology becomes more integrated into mainstream finance, ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring for illicit activities becomes critical. Governments, regulatory bodies, and financial institutions need tools to trace transactions, verify ownership, and monitor suspicious activities across blockchain networks. However, the decentralized nature of blockchain requires advanced tools to efficiently track and audit these activities to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations.

### How  
Our API provides the necessary tools for regulatory bodies and compliance officers to track transactions, balances, and token transfers on the blockchain. By accessing detailed logs, transaction histories, and wallet balances, regulators can verify compliance, trace fund movements, and identify suspicious behavior. Whether tracking large transfers or verifying wallet ownership, our API delivers the transparency needed to maintain the integrity of financial systems and protect against fraudulent activity.

### Achieved Using Our API  
- Track historical transactions and large fund movements using the **`/transactions/{txHash}`** endpoint. This helps regulatory bodies verify transaction authenticity and ensure that no illicit activities are taking place.

    ```http
    GET https://api.histori.xyz/v1/eth-mainnet/transactions/{txHash}
    ```

- Use the **`/chain/logs/contract/{contractAddress}`** endpoint to retrieve detailed logs for a specific smart contract. This allows compliance teams to monitor token transfers or contract interactions that might be part of suspicious activities.

    ```http
    GET https://api.histori.xyz/v1/eth-mainnet/chain/logs/contract/0xabcdefabcdefabcdef?startBlock=123456&endBlock=123999
    ```

- Monitor the ETH/USDT price using the **`/uniswap/eth-usd-price`** endpoint. This is useful for tracking unusual price movements and ensuring that exchange activities are not being manipulated.

    ```http
    GET https://api.histori.xyz/v1/eth-mainnet/uniswap/eth-usd-price
    ```

- Retrieve token allowances using the **`/allowance/single`** endpoint. This enables regulators to track how tokens are allowed to be spent and by whom, which is critical for monitoring dApp interactions and preventing unauthorized transfers.

    ```http
    GET https://api.histori.xyz/v1/eth-mainnet/allowance/single?owner=0x1234567890abcdef&spender=0xabcdefabcdefabcdef&tokenAddress=0xabcdefabcdefabcdef&blockNumber=123456
    ```

- Use the **`/chain/block`** endpoint to obtain detailed information about a specific block. This can help regulators pinpoint the exact time a suspicious transaction occurred, aiding in investigations.

    ```http
    GET https://api.histori.xyz/v1/eth-mainnet/chain/block?blockNumber=123456
    ```

By combining transaction logs, token allowances, contract interactions, and balance histories, regulatory and compliance teams can ensure that all blockchain activities meet regulatory standards. Our API provides the transparency needed to monitor blockchain networks, detect anomalies, and maintain compliance with global financial regulations.
