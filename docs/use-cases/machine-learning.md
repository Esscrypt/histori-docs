title: Machine Learning & Predictive Analytics
---
### Why  
The future of finance, especially in the blockchain space, lies in predictive analytics. Machine learning models can analyze vast amounts of historical blockchain data to predict price movements, identify patterns in market behavior, and even detect potential anomalies. However, these models are only as good as the data they are trained on. Historical data provides the foundation needed to create more accurate predictions, leading to better investment strategies and risk management.

### How  
Our API provides the extensive historical blockchain data necessary to feed machine learning algorithms, from transaction details and wallet activities to token prices and balances. With access to rich datasets, data scientists and developers can train their models, predict market trends, identify suspicious activities, and detect fraud. By leveraging this data, organizations can create sophisticated models that learn from the past to predict the future.

### Achieved Using Our API  
- Use the **`/balance/single`** endpoint to gather historical balance data for specific tokens and wallets, giving a comprehensive look at asset holdings over time.

    ```http
    GET https://api.histori.xyz/v1/eth-mainnet/balance/single?holder=0x1234567890abcdef&tokenAddress=0xabcdefabcdefabcdef&timestamp=2022-01-01T00:00:00Z
    ```

- Retrieve transaction details for any transaction on the blockchain using the **`/transactions/{txHash}`** endpoint. Transaction data is key for understanding market behavior and wallet activities.

    ```http
    GET https://api.histori.xyz/v1/eth-mainnet/transactions/{txHash}
    ```

- To incorporate pricing data, use the **`/uniswap/eth-usd-price`** endpoint to pull historical prices of ETH in relation to USDT. Pricing information plays a significant role in forecasting market movements.

    ```http
    GET https://api.histori.xyz/v1/eth-mainnet/uniswap/eth-usd-price
    ```

By integrating this historical data into machine learning models, organizations can enhance their predictive analytics capabilities, identifying potential market shifts and improving investment strategies.
