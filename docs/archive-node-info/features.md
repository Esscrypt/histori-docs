<!-- # Histori RPC Service Features and Benefits -->

The **Histori RPC Service** provides seamless access to blockchain data across many networks, offering robust features to meet developer and enterprise needs. Below is a comprehensive guide to its features and their benefits.

---

## 1. Multi-Network Support

### Feature
Easily with a wide range of blockchain networks through unified API. Simply modify the `network` path variable and access a new network. A comprehensive list of all supported networks can be found in the [Supported Networks](docs/networks) section

### Why it’s Useful
- Enables developers to interact with multiple networks using a unified API.
- Supports both testnets and mainnets, catering to development and production environments.
- Simplifies integration for decentralized applications (dApps) that operate on multiple chains.

---

## 2. Historical Data Access

### Feature
Query precise historical blockchain data, such as historical blocks, transactions, and state snapshots from multiple archival node providers.

### Why it’s Useful
- Allows for in-depth analysis of past blockchain states.
- Enables applications to verify transactions, understand trends, and build analytics tools.
- Provides access to data required for forensic and compliance purposes.

## 3. Secure Transactions with Flashbots Integration

### Feature
Integration with [Flashbots](https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-protect/overview) for secure, private transaction submission and cancellation. option to choose between maximum MEV rebates or max security when sending transactions.

### Why it’s Useful
- Protects transactions from front-running and MEV (Miner Extractable Value) attacks.
- Provides a private and efficient method for submitting transactions on Ethereum Mainnet.
- Includes capabilities to cancel private transactions when needed.

---

## 4. Fallback Mechanism for High Availability

### Feature
Automatic fallback to alternative RPC providers in case of primary provider failure.

### Why it’s Useful
- Ensures high availability and reliability of the service.
- Reduces downtime and improves user experience during network issues or provider outages.
- Supports uninterrupted operations for critical applications.

## 5. Parallel Requests: Ensuring Data Integrity

### What It Does
When enabled, the Histori RPC Service sends the same request to multiple RPC providers simultaneously and compares their responses. This ensures that all providers return consistent and accurate data.

### Why It Matters
- **Consistency Verification**: By comparing responses from multiple providers, the service detects discrepancies and flags potentially malicious or compromised RPC nodes.
- **Enhanced Security**: Protects users from tampered data or manipulated responses, ensuring trustworthy blockchain data.
- **Reliability**: Even if one provider fails or returns an error, the service ensures accurate results by cross-referencing with other providers.

### Example Use Case
A DeFi platform querying token balances or transaction history can use parallel requests to validate the accuracy of the data. This ensures the platform's calculations and user interfaces reflect the true state of the blockchain.

## 6. Random Provider Selection: Load Balancing and Rate Limit safety

### What It Does
The service can randomly select an RPC provider for each request, distributing the workload evenly across available endpoints. Useful in cases your provider is getting rate-limited by the underlying provider.

### Why It Matters
- **Load Balancing**: Spreads the workload across multiple providers, reducing strain on any single endpoint and improving overall performance.
- **Improved Scalability**: Supports high-traffic applications by optimizing resource utilization across the network.

### Example Use Case
A high-traffic NFT marketplace querying metadata for thousands of tokens can use random provider selection to handle large request volumes efficiently, ensuring uninterrupted user experience.

## Conclusion

The Histori RPC Service offers a feature-rich, reliable, and secure solution for accessing historical blockchain data. Its focus on multi-network support, secure transactions, high availability, and real-time monitoring makes it an essential tool for developers building robust blockchain applications.
